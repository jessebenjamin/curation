        The FCC announced today that it is seeking clearance to allow passenger use of cell phones during flights.  On the tail of a wonderful move allowing electronics throughout the use of the flight, the FCC seeks to go TOO FAR in this instance.  During flights, passengers are forced into a restricted space, often for long periods of time.  Forcing them to listen to the inane, loud, private, personal conversations of a stranger is perhaps the worst idea the FCC has come up with to date.  This would make an already cranky, uncomfortable travel experience exponentially worse, and as a frequent flier and concerned citizen, I think the administration needs to nip this in the bud.  Just because we CAN use our phones at 30,000 feet doesn't mean that we SHOULD be able to. </p>
        Labor is at war with corporate America. Recent legislation makes union organization almost impossible. Corporations feel free to intimidate, harass, and oppress employees to stop unions from organizing workers. Even an EEOC complaint regarding organizing harassment is not allowed. Reform to prevent this corporate misbehavior must be enacted. Harassing, punishing or firing employees for petty issues in order to make an example of them while anti-union or neutral employees are not being punished or fired for the same offenses must not be allowed to continue and needs to be investigated. We need strong legislation to protect all employees who wish to organize. Unions and the middle class need legislation with severe consequences for corporations that interfere with organizational campaigns. </p>
        NASA is the crown jewel of governmental agencies and a central player in the betterment of mankind.  he importance of NASA in the advancement of physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, economics, geography, and oceanography cannot be overstated.  I urge President Obama to lobby Congress to provide the American people a method to allocate a portion of their tax dollars to the direct funding of NASA.  A simple checkbox, similar to how individuals can fund the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, should be added to all IRS tax forms.  <br />"The most power agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing. And that is making dreams come true."<br />- Neil deGrasse Tyson
